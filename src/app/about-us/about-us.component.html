Presently, 38 faculty members along with 36 non-teaching staff are employed for an overall strength of 586 students. Students are exposed to the most modern and up-to-date curriculum and contemporary developments in various disciplines of engineering. In addition to scientific and engineering skills, the institute provides scope to our upcoming graduates to get exposure to team work on experimental projects, presentations and communication skills and active participations in all extracurricular activities. Since necessity is the mother of inventions, our students have participated in every corner of need and took the chaos of early years as an opportunity to grow with self determination and innovation.
